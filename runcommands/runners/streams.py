    """Read streams; mirror and capture output.

    Read from a subprocess's stdout and mirror it to the console's
    stdout (typically sys.stdout) and also capture it into a buffer.
    Ditto for stderr.

    On the input side, read the console's stdin (typicall sys.stdin) and
    mirror it to the subprocess's stdin. Input can be captured too, but
    it typically isn't.

    Args:
        in_ (int, int, bool, list): Read fd, write fd, mirror?, buffer
        out (int, int, bool, list): Read fd, write fd, mirror?, buffer
        err (int, int, bool, list): Read fd, write fd, mirror?, buffer
        chunk_size (int): Number of bytes to read
        finish (bool): Passed by the caller to indicate it's finished
        poll_timeout (float): How long to wait when `select`ing

    File descriptors must be integers. Buffers can be ``None`` to
    disable capture.
